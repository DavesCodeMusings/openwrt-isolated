# openwrt-isolated
This repository exists to hold the documentation for configuring a Raspberry Pi Zero W (or Zero 2W) as a non-internet connected access point. Because there's no wired Ethernet on the Pi Zero W, everything has to be configured at the command prompt. The vast majority of OpenWrt instructions use the web interface. This repository exists to help fill that gap in knowledge.

## For the love of God, man, why?
I'm always looking for ways to upcycle old, obsolete Raspberry Pi hardware. The Pi Zero W is about as low end as you can get, but it can still be useful. OpenWrt is a super lightweight Linux distribution and works well with this little board from 2017. My goal is to create a wifi network for a lab environment, so this combination of Pi Zero and OpenWrt is perfect. 

## Okay, show me how!
1. Start with [Raspberry Pi Zero W as an Isolated WiFi Access Point.md](Raspberry%20Pi%20Zero%20W%20as%20an%20Isolated%20WiFi%20Access%20Point.md)
2. Then, move on to [Improving the OpenWrt Isolated Network Experience.md](Improving%20the%20OpenWrt%20Isolated%20Network%20Experience.md)
3. If you're really motivated, work through [Serving Files from the OpenWrt Raspberry Pi Zero.md](Serving%20Files%20from%20the%20OpenWrt%20Raspberry%20Pi%20Zero.md)

The impatient can jump straight to [tl-dr.sh](tl-dr.sh) for the initial WiFi setup and then figure things out from there.
