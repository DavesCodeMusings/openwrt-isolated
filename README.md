# openwrt-isolated
This repository exists to hold the documentation for configuring a Raspberry Pi Zero W (or Zero 2W) as a non-internet connected access point.

## For the love of God, man, why?
I'm always looking for ways to upcycle old, obsolete Raspberry Pi hardware. The Pi Zero W is about as low end as you can get, but it can still be useful. OpenWrt is a super lightweight Linux distribution and works well with this little board from 2017. My goal is to create a wifi network for a lab environment, so this combination of Pi Zero and OpenWrt is perfect. 

## Okay, show me how!
1. Start with [Raspberry Pi Zero W as an Isolated WiFi Access Point.md](Raspberry%20Pi%20Zero%20W%20as%20an%20Isolated%20WiFi%20Access%20Point.md)
2. Then, move on to [Improving the OpenWrt Isolated Network Experience.md](Improving%20the%20OpenWrt%20Isolated%20Network%20Experience.md)

The impatient can jump straight to tl-dr.sh
